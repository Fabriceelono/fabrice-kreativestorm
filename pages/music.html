          R&B, which stands for Rhythm and Blues, is a genre of popular music
          that originated in African American communities in the United States
          in the late 1940s. Initially, R&B was a term used to describe upbeat,
          dance-oriented music with strong rhythm and blues influences. Over
          time, it evolved to encompass a broader range of styles, including
          soul, funk, and later, contemporary R&B.
